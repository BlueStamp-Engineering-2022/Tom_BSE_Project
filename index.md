# Mecanum Robot
This is a robot that can move in any direction without turning, which is done through the use of wheels with rollers attached to its circumference. By attaching these rollers at a 45 degrees angle, it is able to exert forces sideways when moving forward or backward.

# Starter Project
My starter project is a box with a lever attached. When the lever is flipped on, the box will automatically flip it back off. This is done by moving a resin blade forward, which is caused by flicking the lever on. This resin blade will then flip the lever back off.

# First Milestone
My first milestone is to create the base of my project and verify its full functionality. My project is the mecanum wheels robot, which is able to move sideways using wheels. This is done by adding rollers to the wheels at a 45-degrees angle, which results in sideways forces when the wheels spin in certain ways. I tested this by adding a simple code of fixed directions to my robot. I enjoyed this project because it was mostly building, and not too much programming. Consequently, I realized that one motor was bent in my robot, which resulted in it not being to move straight. I hope to fix this next week, and add more to my robot as well.

# Second Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.
